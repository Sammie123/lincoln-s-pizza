#### By _**{Lincoln Nguyen}**_

## Description

_{A pizza website where the customer enter their name, address, and the different sauces and toppings for their pizza in a form format. I used the checkbox feature where the customer can choose as many of the sauces and toppings as they want. Once done, the customer submits the order and display a summary of the chosen sauces and toppings along with the total price. This website is an exercise for Epicodus students to challenge using contructors, objects, and prototype.}_
